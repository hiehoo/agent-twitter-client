      "text": "Hyperliquid Memecoins VS. Solana Memecoins\n\nI guess last night’s Hypio space inspired me to write more about my current meme coin trading experience.\nThis isn’t a post to start a war, it’s just my thoughts. Don't take it personal - I'm not fudding your bags. I also got rugged here.\n\n1/ Sol Meme Coins\nI’ve been trading memes for a few years, started with ETH/BSC/other ecosystems, and mostly on Solana.\nSadly, the trenches are now completely cooked. Solana has become a playground for insiders and jeeters only.\nAnd let’s not forget Wintermute's amazing role in dumping a bunch of tokens.\n\n1.1/ The Launch of https://t.co/rby9mJySGk\nRecently, https://t.co/rby9mJySGk launched with a 6-figure airdrop campaign for top yappers/KOLs.\nThe requirements? They need to launch a token and hit market cap milestones to reduce unlock times (200k -> 500k -> 1.25M -> 5M MC).\n\nI’ve always believed community is the soul of any project, especially meme coins. And yeah, tier 1 and tier 2 KOLs have a natural edge here: they understand meme culture, they have reach, followers and they can rally a following better than your average dev or normie.\n\nThe results? Kinda tragic: https://t.co/Tal7g2Qemo\n\nATH of the biggest token launched by a tier 1 KOL was $14M -> now sitting at $200k.\n\n$BETTY, one of the earliest projects, hit ~$8M on day one -> $2M on day two -> now $170k.\n\n80% of tokens launched on Boop die within hours. The other 20% survive 2–4 days, if lucky.\n\nI don’t blame the KOLs, many were transparent about only launching for the airdrop.\nSome even got support from Boop’s founder, yet still couldn’t survive.\nTurns out, even top influencers can’t bring liquidity to Sol meme coins anymore.\n\n1.2/ The Current Sol Meme Landscape\nOver the past few weeks, no token has been strong enough to lead the narrative.\n\nWe had #HOUSECOIN, supported by big names, but even with solid community support, it still couldn’t break $120M MC. It's still one of the most promising Sol meme coins rn tho. \nThe coins riding on its hype barely last 1–3 days.\n\nThen came #CHILLHOUSE - one of the better ones,  backed by Based, peaked at $10M, now sitting at $2M.\nStill not even close.\n\nAnd $GORK - a whole mess of variations. Elon Musk even changed his name and PFP to promote it.\nThe result? A 15–30 minute pump, then a slow, quiet death. Then another 5 - 10 $GORK were launching, no one knows which one is the real one.\nOther Gork meta like $FUCKCOIN and $HORNI dropped 90%.\nEven Elon couldn’t save them.\n\nAnd then came $POPE, a \"crime token\" launched by the $TRUMP team. From $400M -> $50M, with no real pump. People didn’t even bother buying it.\n\nThings got extra spicy with the Zerebro dev’s fake suicide stunt.\nHe faked his death, launched #LLJEFFY to celebrate it, dumped $ZEREBRO, bought into his own “legacy token”…\nAnd #LLJEFFY did a 100x. Then dumped 90% after Irene exposed that he was still alive.\n\nPeople really out here tokenizing their own death for a bag?????????? Seriously?\nBut even that narrative only lasted 2-3 days.\n\nRight now? No real narrative on Sol.\nEvery day brings a new token, a quick pump for 1–3 days, then onto the next one.\nNo $WIF, no $BONK. People jeet their bags after a 10% gain.\nIf their coin doesn’t pump in 5 minutes, they’re out.\nOnly insiders are winning here.\n\nPEOPLE. CAN. NOT. HOLD.\n\nThere’s no real liquidity, no new users, and no narrative.\nThe trenches are cooked.\nBTC is heading toward $100K - meanwhile, Sol memes are just bleeding.\n\n2/ Hyperliquid Meme Coins\nMeanwhile, the Hyperliquid meme coin scene is still early - fresh trenches.\nIt started with HypurrFun, where a lot of people made money.\n\nNow it’s HyperEVM season.\n$BUDDY was the first meme on HyperEVM, and tbh it’s always the strongest.\n\nI’m genuinely shocked by what $BUDDY has achieved.\nEven with 73% of the supply airdropped to the Hyperliquid community and projects, the chart just keeps going up while the rest of the market bleeds.\nPeople keep buying, and Hypios are working together to support it.\n“Alright buddy” is basically culture now, alongside “Hypio.”\n\nThe difference is clear:\nYou can’t hold a Sol meme coin longer than a day (if you’re lucky).\nBut you can hold Hyperliquid meme coins and feel so comfy about it.\nIt’s a no-brainer.\n\nOn Hyperliquid, people genuinely support each other.\n\n$BUDDY is leading the narrative, and $RUB is following.\nWhen I first checked my $RUB airdrop, it was worth $150.\nA few weeks later? $1000.\nNow? $2500.\n\nIt reminds me of the early ETH meme days when communities were strong and holders had actual diamond hands.\n\nSo yup, I’m not selling my $EVM and $LUBE airdrops right now.\nThis is clearly just the beginning of the airdrop narrative.\n\nHyperliquid isn’t a playground for scammers, insiders, or cabals.\nIf someone asked me the best chain to build on right now, I wouldn’t hesitate cuz it’s 100% Hyperliquid.\n\nIf I had just stuck 100% with Hyperliquid, I wouldn’t be losing sleep staring at charts and watching Sol trenches crumble 24/7.\n\nHyperliquid.\n\nBanner by @baynPSD",

      "text": "HyperXplore #2 - Pocket Pro @pp_trading \n*Sign up with my referral link for 10% off fees: https://t.co/NfJ672x7Ov\n\nA lot of people have asked me: what's the best strategy to make money/farm airdrops?\nFor me, the answer is being early, especially when you’re starting with low capital.\nMore and more projects are launching on Hyperliquid, and this could be your chance to be early.

Thanks a lot for reading, and lmk if there are any new alphas you want me to try!",
